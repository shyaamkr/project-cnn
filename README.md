CNN Problem Statement Solutions - This repository showcases my solutions to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) problem statement. 
It includes all relevant Python code, data preprocessing steps, model architectures, training and evaluation scripts, and clear documentation of results. 
The implementation leverages leading deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
Key components: 
• Data preparation and augmentation 
• Custom CNN model design and training 
• Hyperparameter optimization and validation 
• Performance metrics and visualizations 
• Easy-to-follow instructions for replicating results  This repo is intended for learners interested in understanding practical approaches to CNN-based problem-solving.
